Biography
======
I am an associate professor at School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University. Before joining Yunnan University, I worked as Senior Applied Scientist at <a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/">Tencent</a> from Sep. 2021 to Jan. 2023. I received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh, UK</a> in May 2021, working on semantic parsing and text generation (<a href="https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/37936">Ph.D. thesis</a>). I interned at <a href="https://research.google/"> Google Research </a> and <a href="https://allenai.org/"> Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a> during my PhD study. Before starting my Ph.D. study, I worked as research assistant at <a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore</a> on syntactic parsing from Apr. 2015 to Aug. 2017. I received my M.Sc. degree and B.Sc. degree from <a href="https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/">Beijing Jiaotong University, China</a> in June 2008 and March 2012, respectively, working on statistical machine translation between Japanese and Chinese.

Research Interests
======
My research interests include computational linguistics, natural language processing and deep learning. I serve as reviewer for journals such as Computational Linguistics, ACM Transactions on Asian and Low Resource Language Information Processing, IEEE Transactions on Big Data, Information Science, ISA Transactions. I am also PC member for conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, NAACL, EACL, EMNLP and COLING. I am a co-chair of the student research workshop in ACL (2020), and the area chairs of COLING (2022).
