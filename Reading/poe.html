<h1>Principles of Economics </h1>
<p>this book is written by N. Gregory Mankiw</p>
<h3>Part one Introduction</h3>
<h4>Ten principles</h4>
<strong>How people make decisions</strong><br />
1,  people face tradeoffs<br />
There  is no such thing as a free lunch. Making decisions requires trading off one  goal against another. <br />
E.g.  how to allocate his own most valuable resource for a student. Part-time job or  study<br />
E.g.  how to spend their family income for parents. Buy goods or children education<br />
E.g.  Classic tradeoff is between &ldquo;guns and butter&rdquo;.<br />
E.g.  society faces tradeoff between efficiency and equity. If a cake divided more equally,  the smaller the cake is produced. Tax can be used to controlled this society  cake.<br />
2,  the cost of something is what you give up to get it<br />
In  many cases, however, the cost of some action is not as obvious as it might  first appear.<br />
E.g.  the decision whether to go to college. We need to consider many attributes,  time and cost.<br />
Opportunity  cost of an item is what you give up to get that item<br />
3,  rational people think at the margin<br />
Margin  change is used to describe small incremental adjustments to an existing plan of  action<br />
Margin  costs lead to margin benefits<br />
E.g.  the airline deciding how much to charge passengers who fly standby<br />
4,  people respond to incentives<br />
The  behavior may change when the costs or benefits change. However, the result of  some action cannot be clearly predicted. Sometime these actions can end up with  result that is not intended.<br />
E.g.  improving auto safety, to assign seat belts, finally more accidents (including  driver without seat belts and pedestrians)</p>
<p><strong>How  people interact</strong><br />
  5,  trade can make everyone better off<br />
  By  trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at  lower cost.<br />
  6,  markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity<br />
  Free  market contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and services, and all  of them are interested primarily in their own well-being.<br />
  One  invisible hand pushes this kind of economics. The policy published by government  on market economic will indirectly limit the ability of this invisible hand.<br />
  7,  government can sometime improve market outcome<br />
  The  invisible hand usually leads markets to allocate resources efficiently. However,  sometimes it own fails and it called market failures.<br />
  E.g.  externality is the impact of one person&rsquo;s action on the well-being of a  bystander. That is pollution. <br />
  E.g.  market power is the ability of a single economic actor (or small group of  actors) to have a substantial influence on market power. That is monopoly.<br />
The  invisible hand is even less able to ensure that economic prosperity is  distributed fairly.</p>
<p><strong>How  the economy as a whole works</strong><br />
  8,  a country standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and  services<br />
  Productivity  is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker&rsquo;s time. <br />
  Productivity  is the primary determinant of living standards. <br />
  Policy  affects living standards, and the key question is how it will affect our  ability to produce goods and services.<br />
  E.g.  the government&rsquo;s budget deficit. We need to consider borrowing balance among  borrowers, student education, physical capital and etc. <br />
  9,  prices rise when the government prints too much money<br />
  Inflation<br />
  The  larger the quantity of money is, the small the value of money is, the higher  prices are.<br />
  10,  society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment<br />
  Reducing  inflation causes rise in unemployment.<br />
  Phillips  curve is the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.<br />
  The  tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is only temporary, but it can last  for several years.<br />
Because  of the sticky property of money, during short period, reduce inflation. In next  period, reduce unemployment. This is short-run strategy.

<h3>Part two Thinking like an  economist</h3>
  <h4>The  economist as scientist</h4>
  Economist  approach study of economy in much the same way as a physicist approaches the study  of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life<br />
  The  whole of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking –  Albert Einstein.
<h4>The  scientific method: observation, theory, and more observation</h4>
  E.g.  an economist lives in a country experiencing rapid increases in price and by  this observation develop a theory of inflation. Then to test this theory,  finally get a conclusion.<br />
  Experiments  are often difficult in economics. Large numbers of data are processed during  long period time.<br />
  Experiments  need different roles of assumption and economic models.<br />
  E.g.  the circular-flow diagram<br />
  E.g.  the production possibilities frontier
<h4>Microeconomics  and macroeconomics</h4>
  Microeconomics  is the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact  in markets.<br />
  Macroeconomics  is the study of economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and  economic growth<br />
  Microeconomics  and macroeconomics are closely intertwined. Because changes in the overall  economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals, and decision  depends on understanding macroeconomic developments.<br />
  Despite  the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the two fields are  distinct.
<h4>The  economist as policy adviser</h4>
  Positive  versus normative analysis<br />
  Positive  statements are descriptive as what scientist says<br />
  E.g.  minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.<br />
  Normative  statement are perspective as what policy adviser says<br />
  E.g.  the government should raise the minimum wage.
<h4>Economist  in Washington </h4>
  President  Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist. When he  asked his economist for advice, they always answered, &ldquo;on the one hand…, one  the other hand…&rdquo;
<h4>Why  economists disagree</h4>
  <p><strong>Difference  in scientific judgments</strong><br />
  Economists  may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories about how the  world works.<br />
  E.g.  economists disagree about whether the government should levy taxes based on a  household&rsquo;s income or its consumption (spending).<br />
  <strong>Difference  in values</strong><br />
    Economists  may have different values and, therefore, different normative views about what  policy should try to accomplish.<br />
    E.g.  Peter has income of $50000 and is taxed $5000, or 10 percent of his income.  Paul has income of $10000 and is taxed $2000, or 20 percent of his income. Is  this policy fair? </p>
    <h4>Perception  versus reality</h4>
    Because  of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some  disagreement among economists is inevitable
